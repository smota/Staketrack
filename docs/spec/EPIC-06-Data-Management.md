# EPIC-06: Data Management

## Overview

The Data Management epic covers functionality for importing, exporting, backing up, and synchronizing stakeholder data. This capability ensures data persistence across devices, provides data portability between systems, and safeguards user information through proper backup and recovery mechanisms.

## Features

### Feature 6.1: Data Import and Export

Allow users to transfer stakeholder data in and out of the system.

#### Stories

**So that** I can work with my stakeholder data anywhere.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System detects when offline and notifies user
- All core functionality remains available offline
- Changes are stored locally until connection is restored
- User can see which changes are pending synchronization
- System automatically syncs when connection is restored
- User receives notification of successful sync after reconnection

**Notes:**
- Implement local storage for offline data persistence
- Consider storage limits for offline mode
- Prioritize which features must work offline vs. online-only

##### Story 6.2.3: Multi-Device Access

**As a** user,
**I want to** access my stakeholder maps from multiple devices,
**So that** I can work flexibly across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can log in from any device to access their maps
- UI adapts appropriately to device screen size
- Synchronization happens automatically across devices
- Last-used map and view settings are preserved across devices
- Changes made on one device appear on others after sync
- User can see which device last modified the data

**Notes:**
- Test synchronization edge cases thoroughly
- Consider device-specific optimizations for performance
- Implement responsive design for all screen sizes

### Feature 6.3: Data Backup and Recovery

Ensure stakeholder data can be recovered in case of accidental changes or data loss.

#### Stories

##### Story 6.3.1: Automatic Backups

**As a** user,
**I want to** have my data automatically backed up at regular intervals,
**So that** I can recover from accidental changes or deletions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System creates automatic backups at configurable intervals
- Backups are stored securely in the cloud (for authenticated users)
- User can see when the last backup was created

- Backup storage is managed to prevent excessive space usage

**Notes:**
- Consider incremental backup strategy for efficiency
- Implement backup rotation policy to manage storage
- Ensure backups are encrypted for security

##### Story 6.3.2: Restore from Backup

**As a** user,
**I want to** restore my stakeholder data from a previous backup,
**So that** I can recover from mistakes or data corruption.
