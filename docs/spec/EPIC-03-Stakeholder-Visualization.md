# EPIC-03: Stakeholder Visualization

## Overview

The Stakeholder Visualization epic covers the visual representation of stakeholders in different formats, with a primary focus on the Influence-Impact Matrix. This functionality helps users understand stakeholder relationships, prioritize engagement efforts, and make strategic decisions about stakeholder management.

## Features

### Feature 3.1: Influence-Impact Matrix

Provide a visual quadrant-based matrix to plot stakeholders based on their influence and impact.

#### Stories

##### Story 3.1.1: Matrix View Display

**As a** user,
**I want to** view my stakeholders plotted on an influence-impact matrix,
**So that** I can understand their strategic importance at a glance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Matrix displays with four quadrants labeled appropriately
- X-axis represents influence (low to high)
- Y-axis represents impact (low to high)
- Each stakeholder appears as a data point on the matrix
- Quadrants are clearly labeled with recommended engagement strategies
- Matrix automatically scales based on the number of stakeholders

**Notes:**
- Quadrant labels: "Key Players" (high influence/high impact), "Meet Their Needs" (low influence/high impact), "Show Consideration" (low influence/low impact), "Keep Satisfied" (high influence/low impact)
- Consider color-coding quadrants for clearer visual distinction

##### Story 3.1.2: Stakeholder Plot Representation

**As a** user,
**I want to** see stakeholders represented as distinct visual elements on the matrix,
**So that** I can identify them and understand their attributes quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each stakeholder is represented by a circular plot point
- Plot size represents relationship quality (larger = stronger relationship)
- Plot color represents stakeholder category
- Stakeholder name appears on hover
- Plot positioning accurately reflects influence (x-axis) and impact (y-axis) values
- Visual indication for new or recently modified stakeholders

**Notes:**
- Ensure sufficient contrast between plot colors for accessibility
- Consider adding a legend explaining the visual encoding

##### Story 3.1.3: Matrix Interaction

**As a** user,
**I want to** interact with stakeholder plots on the matrix,
**So that** I can access details and take actions without changing views.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can hover over a plot to see basic stakeholder information
- User can click a plot to select the stakeholder
- Selected stakeholder shows a detail panel with full information
- User can directly edit stakeholder from the detail panel
- User can access additional actions (delete, duplicate, etc.) from detail panel
- User can drag and drop stakeholders to new positions to update influence/impact values

**Notes:**
- Ensure touch screen compatibility for mobile users
- Implement smooth animations for state changes

##### Story 3.1.4: Matrix Filtering and Highlighting

**As a** user,
**I want to** filter and highlight specific stakeholders on the matrix,
**So that** I can focus on subsets of stakeholders for analysis.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can filter stakeholders by category, relationship quality, or custom criteria
- Non-matching stakeholders are either hidden or visually de-emphasized
- User can highlight specific stakeholders for comparison
- User can search for stakeholders by name and have them highlighted
- Filtering controls are accessible directly from the matrix view
- Filter state is preserved during the session

**Notes:**
- Consider adding preset filters for common scenarios
- Ensure the matrix scales appropriately when filters reduce the number of visible stakeholders

### Feature 3.2: List View

Provide an alternative tabular representation of stakeholders for detailed comparison.

#### Stories

##### Story 3.2.1: List View Display

**As a** user,
**I want to** view my stakeholders in a sortable, filterable list,
**So that** I can analyze and compare their attributes in a structured format.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- List displays stakeholders in a table format
- Columns include Name/Role, Influence, Impact, Relationship, Category, and Actions
- User can toggle between matrix view and list view with a single click
- Transitions between views are smooth and maintain context
- List view shows the same stakeholders as currently filtered in matrix view

**Notes:**
- Consider allowing customization of visible columns
- Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes

##### Story 3.2.2: Sorting and Ordering

**As a** user,
**I want to** sort stakeholders by different attributes,
**So that** I can identify patterns and priorities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can click column headers to sort the list
- Sorting works for all columns
- Clicking a column header toggles between ascending and descending order
- Visual indication shows the current sort column and direction
- Sort preference is remembered during the session
- Default sort is by name in ascending order

**Notes:**
- Consider multi-column sorting for advanced users
- Ensure numeric sorting for numeric values (not string-based)

##### Story 3.2.3: List View Interaction

**As a** user,
**I want to** interact with stakeholders in the list view,
**So that** I can efficiently manage them without switching views.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can select stakeholders via checkboxes
- Action buttons (Edit, Delete, etc.) are available for each row
- Inline editing is supported for quick updates to key fields
- Bulk actions are available for selected stakeholders
- Row hover state provides visual feedback
- Double-clicking a row opens the full edit form

**Notes:**
- Consider keyboard navigation support for power users
- Ensure consistent interaction patterns with the matrix view

### Feature 3.3: Visualization Settings

Allow users to customize visualization preferences.

#### Stories

##### Story 3.3.1: Matrix Display Options

**As a** user,
**I want to** customize how the matrix displays stakeholders,
**So that** the visualization meets my specific needs and preferences.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can access matrix display settings
- User can choose different visualizations for plot attributes (size, color, shape)
- User can toggle labels visibility
- User can adjust the density of the matrix
- User can save visualization preferences
- Changes apply immediately with visual feedback

**Notes:**
- Consider presets for common visualization preferences
- Ensure all customizations maintain accessibility

##### Story 3.3.2: Data Thresholds

**As a** user,
**I want to** set custom thresholds for influence and impact levels,
**So that** the quadrant boundaries align with my project's specific context.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can adjust the threshold between "low" and "high" for both axes
- Default is the midpoint (5.5 on a 1-10 scale)
- Visual feedback shows how stakeholders redistribution across quadrants
- Threshold settings are saved with the map
- Reset option returns to default values

**Notes:**
- Consider allowing more granular segmentation (beyond 2x2)
- Ensure threshold changes are visually clear

##### Story 3.3.3: Export Visualizations

**As a** user,
**I want to** export the matrix and list views as images or data,
**So that** I can include them in reports or presentations.

- User can export the list as data (CSV, Excel)
- Export includes current filters and highlights
- Exported images are high resolution and professionally styled
- Export includes a timestamp and map name

**Notes:**

##### Story 3.4.3: Movement Tracking

**As a** user,
**I want to** track stakeholder movement across the matrix over time,
**So that** I can evaluate the effectiveness of my engagement strategies.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System captures stakeholder positions at regular intervals or when explicitly saved
- User can view a "movement map" showing trajectories
