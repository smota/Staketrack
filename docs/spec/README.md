# StakeTrack Application Specification

## Overview

StakeTrack is a stakeholder management application designed to help organizations track, visualize, and manage their relationships with key stakeholders. This document outlines the high-level requirements and technical specifications for the application.

## Epics

The application functionality is organized into the following epics:

1. [User Management](EPIC-01-User-Management.md) - User registration, authentication, and profile management
2. [Stakeholder Management](EPIC-02-Stakeholder-Management.md) - Creating, updating, and organizing stakeholders
3. [Stakeholder Matrix](EPIC-03-Stakeholder-Matrix.md) - Visualizing stakeholders in an influence/impact matrix
4. [Communication Tracking](EPIC-04-Communication-Tracking.md) - Recording and analyzing stakeholder interactions
5. [AI Recommendations](EPIC-05-AI-Recommendations.md) - AI-powered engagement advice and insights

Each epic is further broken down into features and user stories with detailed acceptance criteria.

## Technical Architecture

StakeTrack is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: Vue.js with Vuetify for UI components
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions)
- **AI Services**: Firebase Vertex AI with Gemini models

## Performance Requirements

The application is designed to handle:

- Up to 1,000 active users
- Up to 500 stakeholders per map
- Up to 1,000 interactions per stakeholder
- Response times under 1 second for non-AI operations
