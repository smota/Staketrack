## Sample Detailed Test Cases

### Feature 3.1: Matrix View

#### Story 3.1.1: 2x2 Matrix View

##### Test Case TS-03-1-1-01: Matrix View Rendering (P0)

**Objective**: Verify that the 2x2 matrix view renders correctly with axes and quadrants.

**Preconditions**:
- User is logged in
- A stakeholder map with at least 1 stakeholder exists

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to the stakeholder map
2. Select "Matrix View" option if not already selected
3. Observe the rendering of the matrix

**Expected Results**:
- Matrix displays with an X-axis labeled "Impact"
- Matrix displays with a Y-axis labeled "Influence"
- Matrix is divided into 4 quadrants
- Quadrants are visually distinct
- Axes have numerical indicators from 1-10
- Matrix is responsive to screen size

**Test Data**:
- Existing stakeholder map with sample stakeholders

##### Test Case TS-03-1-3-01: Stakeholder Positioning Accuracy (P0)

**Objective**: Verify that stakeholders are positioned correctly in the matrix based on their impact and influence values.

**Preconditions**:
- User is logged in
- A stakeholder map with multiple stakeholders exists with varying impact and influence values

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to the stakeholder map
2. Select "Matrix View" option
3. Identify a stakeholder with known impact and influence values
4. Check position of the stakeholder in the matrix

**Expected Results**:
- Stakeholder is positioned accurately on the X-axis according to impact value
- Stakeholder is positioned accurately on the Y-axis according to influence value
- Position is consistent with the numerical values assigned to the stakeholder
- Multiple stakeholders are positioned correctly relative to each other

**Test Data**:
- Stakeholder 1: Impact 3, Influence 8
- Stakeholder 2: Impact 9, Influence 2
- Stakeholder 3: Impact 5, Influence 5

### Feature 3.2: Visual Representation

#### Story 3.2.1: Color Coding

##### Test Case TS-03-2-1-01: Relationship Quality Color Coding (P1)

**Objective**: Verify that stakeholders are color-coded correctly based on relationship quality.

**Preconditions**:
- User is logged in
- A stakeholder map with stakeholders having various relationship quality values exists
- Color coding for relationship quality is enabled

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to the stakeholder map
2. Select "Matrix View" option
3. Observe the color of stakeholders with different relationship quality values
4. Check color legend if available

**Expected Results**:
- Stakeholders with high relationship quality (7-10) appear green
- Stakeholders with medium relationship quality (4-6) appear yellow/amber
- Stakeholders with low relationship quality (1-3) appear red
- Color coding is consistent across all stakeholders
- Color legend accurately reflects the displayed colors

**Test Data**:

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Performance degradation with many stakeholders | High | Medium | Implement canvas rendering, optimize DOM manipulation, pagination for large datasets |
| Inconsistent rendering across browsers | Medium | High | Comprehensive cross-browser testing, use of standardized libraries |
| Touch interactions not working on mobile | High | Medium | Device-specific testing, fallback interactions |
| Color accessibility issues | Medium | Medium | Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for color contrast, alternative visualizations |
