## Test Environment Configuration

### Database Configuration

- Firestore database with interaction collection
- Test data preloaded for various test scenarios
- Relationships established between stakeholders and interactions

### Notification Configuration

- Mock notification service for testing reminders

## Automation Strategy

The following test cases are prioritized for automation:
- All CRUD operations for interactions
- Form validation tests
- Basic interaction history display
- Reminder creation and completion

Manual testing focus areas:
- UI/UX of interaction forms
- File attachment handling
- Notification delivery and display
- Complex filtering and searching scenarios
- Analysis and reporting features

## Traceability Matrix

| Test Case ID | User Story ID | Requirement ID | Test Type | Priority | Automation Status |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| TS-04-1-1-01 | 4.1.1 | REQ-INT-001 | Functional | P0 | Automated |
| TS-04-1-1-02 | 4.1.1 | REQ-INT-002 | Validation | P0 | Automated |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Data loss for interactions | High | Low | Implement auto-save, robust error handling, data recovery |
| Notification failure | Medium | Medium | Implement redundant notification channels, verification of delivery |
| File attachment security issues | High | Medium | Implement file scanning, size limits, allowed file types |
| Performance degradation with many interactions | Medium | Medium | Implement pagination, lazy loading, archive old interactions |
