# TEST-02: Stakeholder Management Test Specification

## Test Plan Overview

This document outlines the test plan for the Stakeholder Management epic, covering stakeholder map creation, stakeholder profile management, categorization, and batch operations.

### Scope

Testing will cover all functionality described in [EPIC-02: Stakeholder Management](../EPIC-02-Stakeholder-Management.md).

### Test Approach

1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual stakeholder management functions in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Test stakeholder management flows in context of the application
3. **UI Testing**: Validate stakeholder management interface elements and interactions
4. **Data Integrity Testing**: Verify stakeholder data is properly stored and retrieved
5. **Performance Testing**: Verify system handles large numbers of stakeholders efficiently

### Test Environment Requirements

- Development environment with Firebase Firestore enabled
- Sample stakeholder data sets of varying sizes
- Multiple browser configurations for UI testing
- Mobile device emulators for responsive testing

## Sample Detailed Test Cases

### Feature 2.1: Stakeholder Maps

#### Story 2.1.1: Create Stakeholder Map

##### Test Case TS-02-1-1-01: Successful Map Creation (P0)

**Objective**: Verify that a user can create a new stakeholder map.

**Preconditions**:
- User is logged in
- User has permission to create maps

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to the dashboard
2. Click "Create New Map" button
3. Enter a name for the map: "Test Project Stakeholders"
4. Enter a description: "Stakeholder map for testing"
5. Click "Save" button

**Expected Results**:
- New map is created successfully
- User is redirected to the new empty map
- Map name and description are displayed correctly
- Map is saved to local storage and cloud (if authenticated)

**Test Data**:
- Map Name: "Test Project Stakeholders"
- Map Description: "Stakeholder map for testing"

### Feature 2.2: Stakeholder Profiles

#### Story 2.2.1: Add Stakeholder

##### Test Case TS-02-2-1-01: Create Stakeholder with Required Fields (P0)

**Objective**: Verify that a user can add a new stakeholder with only required fields.

**Preconditions**:
- User is logged in
- A stakeholder map exists and is active

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to the active stakeholder map
2. Click "Add Stakeholder" button
3. Enter name: "John Smith - VP Operations"
4. Set Influence: 8
5. Set Impact: 7
6. Set Relationship Quality: 6
7. Click "Save" button

**Expected Results**:

- Stakeholder appears in both matrix and list views
- Stakeholder position in matrix matches the influence and impact values
- Success message is displayed
- Stakeholder data is saved to database

**Test Data**:
- Name: "John Smith - VP Operations"
- Influence: 8 (high)
- Impact: 7 (high)
- Relationship Quality: 6 (medium)

## Test Data Requirements

### Sample Stakeholder Maps

| Map Name | Description | # of Stakeholders |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Empty Map | For testing new map functionality | 0 |
| Small Project | For testing basic functionality | 5-10 |
| Large Enterprise | For testing performance with many stakeholders | 50+ |

### Sample Stakeholder Profiles

| Name | Role | Influence | Impact | Relationship | Category |
|------|------|-----------|--------|-------------|----------|

## Test Environment Configuration

### Database Configuration

- Firestore database with appropriate security rules
- Test data preloaded for various test scenarios
- Firestore emulator for local testing

### UI Testing Configuration

- Various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Multiple browsers for compatibility testing
- Accessibility testing tools configured

## Automation Strategy

The following test cases are prioritized for automation:
- All P0 test cases
- CRUD operations for stakeholders and maps
- Data validation tests
- Bulk operations with large data sets

Manual testing focus areas:
- UI/UX evaluation
- Matrix visualization correctness
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Complex filtering and categorization scenarios
