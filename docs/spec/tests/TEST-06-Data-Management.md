- Preview shows correct data and field mappings
- Import process completes without errors
- Success message displays with count of imported stakeholders
- All stakeholders from CSV appear in stakeholder map
- Stakeholder data matches source CSV file
- Import operation is recorded in system logs

**Test Data**:
- File: "valid_stakeholders.csv" with 10 stakeholders
- Fields: Name, Role, Organization, Influence (1-10), Impact (1-10), Relationship (1-10)

##### Test Case TS-06-1-1-02: CSV Import Field Validation (P0)

**Objective**: Verify that the system validates required fields and data types during CSV import.

**Preconditions**:
- User is logged in
- A stakeholder map exists and is active
- User has a CSV file with missing required fields and invalid data

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to data management section
2. Select "Import Data" option
3. Choose "Import Stakeholders" option
4. Select CSV format
5. Browse and select test file "invalid_stakeholders.csv"
6. Observe validation warnings on preview screen
7. Click "Import" button

**Expected Results**:
- CSV file uploads and preview displays
- System identifies and highlights missing required fields (Name, Influence, Impact)
- System identifies and highlights invalid data values
- Error message displays explaining validation issues
- Import button is disabled until critical issues are resolved
- No invalid data is imported into the system
- User is provided clear guidance on fixing the issues

**Test Data**:
- File: "invalid_stakeholders.csv" with multiple validation issues:
  - Row 2: Missing name

|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Data loss during import/export | High | Low | Transaction handling, atomic operations, validation before commit |
| Performance issues with large datasets | Medium | Medium | Chunked processing, progress indicators, background processing |
| Data corruption during file conversion | High | Low | Checksums, format validation, preview before commit |
| Privacy breaches during export | High | Low | Export permissions, content filtering, audit logging |
| Synchronization conflicts | Medium | Medium | Conflict resolution strategy, last-write-wins with history |
