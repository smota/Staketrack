# StakeTrack Test Specifications

This directory contains test specifications for the StakeTrack application, organized to align with the EPIC → FEATURE → STORY structure.

## Overview

Each test specification document maps to a corresponding EPIC and details test plans, test cases, and test scenarios for validating the functionality described in user stories. The test specifications follow industry best practices for test design, execution, and reporting.

## Test Specification Structure

Each test specification includes:

- **Test Plan**: Overall approach and strategy for testing the EPIC
- **Test Coverage Matrix**: Mapping between test cases and user stories
- **Test Cases**: Individual test scenarios with steps, expected results, and pass/fail criteria
- **Test Data Requirements**: Sample data needed for testing
- **Test Environment Requirements**: Configuration needed for test execution

## Test Specifications by EPIC

1. [Authentication Test Specification](TEST-01-Authentication.md) - Testing user registration, login, and session management
2. [Stakeholder Management Test Specification](TEST-02-Stakeholder-Management.md) - Testing stakeholder profile creation and organization
3. [Stakeholder Visualization Test Specification](TEST-03-Stakeholder-Visualization.md) - Testing matrix view and visual representations
4. [Interaction Tracking Test Specification](TEST-04-Interaction-Tracking.md) - Testing interaction logging and analysis
5. [AI Recommendations Test Specification](TEST-05-AI-Recommendations.md) - Testing AI-powered engagement advice
6. [Data Management Test Specification](TEST-06-Data-Management.md) - Testing data import/export, synchronization, and backup

## Test Case ID Format

Test cases follow a standardized ID format for easy reference and traceability:

`TS-<EPIC#>-<FEATURE#>-<STORY#>-<CASE#>`

For example, `TS-01-1-2-03` refers to:
- Epic 1 (Authentication)
- Feature 1 (User Registration)
- Story 2 (Google Authentication)
- Test Case 3

## Test Prioritization

Tests are prioritized using the following categories:

- **P0**: Critical path tests that validate core functionality
- **P1**: Important tests for key features but not on the critical path
- **P2**: Edge cases and non-critical functionality tests
- **P3**: Nice-to-have tests for minor features or rare scenarios

## Test Types

The test specifications include various test types:

- **Functional Tests**: Verify functionality works as expected
- **Integration Tests**: Verify components work together correctly
- **UI Tests**: Verify user interface elements and interactions
- **Performance Tests**: Verify response times and resource usage
- **Security Tests**: Verify data protection and access controls
- **Accessibility Tests**: Verify application is accessible to all users
- **Cross-Browser Tests**: Verify functionality across different browsers
- **Responsive Design Tests**: Verify application functions on different screen sizes

## Relationship to Other Documentation

These test specifications should be read in conjunction with:

- [EPIC Specifications](../README.md) - For detailed functional requirements
- [Testing Guide](../../TESTING.md) - For test execution procedures and tools
- [Run and Debug Guide](../../RUN_DEBUG.md) - For running tests in development environment
