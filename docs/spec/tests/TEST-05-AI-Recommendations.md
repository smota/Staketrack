- Each recommendation includes a clear action item
- Recommendations have contextual explanations for why they are suggested
- Recommendations adapt to recent interaction history

**Test Data**:
- Stakeholder: "John Smith - VP Operations"
- Recent interactions: 1 meeting (30 days ago), 2 emails (15 and 5 days ago)
- Stakeholder position: High influence, high impact

##### Test Case TS-05-1-1-02: Recommendation Quality with Limited Data (P1)

**Objective**: Verify that the system generates reasonable recommendations even with limited stakeholder data.

**Preconditions**:
- User is logged in
- A stakeholder exists with minimal profile information (only name, influence, impact)
- The stakeholder has no recorded interactions
- AI recommendation feature is enabled

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to stakeholder detail page
2. Locate and view "AI Recommendations" section
3. Check for "Suggested Next Steps" recommendations
4. Review the recommended actions

**Expected Results**:
- System acknowledges limited data available
- System provides generic but useful initial engagement recommendations
- Recommendations suggest gathering more information
- No false assumptions are made based on limited data
- Clear explanation that recommendations will improve with more data

**Test Data**:
- Stakeholder: "New Stakeholder"
- Influence: 8/10
- Impact: 7/10
- No other data available

### Feature 5.2: Stakeholder Insights

#### Story 5.2.1: Relationship Trends

##### Test Case TS-05-2-1-01: Detect Positive Relationship Trend (P1)

**Objective**: Verify that the system can accurately detect and report a positive trend in stakeholder relationship quality.

**Preconditions**:
- User is logged in
- A stakeholder exists with at least 6 months of interaction history
- Interaction frequency has increased over time
